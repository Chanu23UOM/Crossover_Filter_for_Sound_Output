# ðŸŽ¶ 3-Way Crossover Filter Design (LTspice)

This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a **3-way crossover filter** for audio systems, implemented and tested in **LTspice**.  

Crossover networks are essential in **headphones and speaker systems** to split the audio spectrum into frequency ranges handled by dedicated drivers:
- **Woofer** â†’ Low frequencies  
- **Midrange** â†’ Mid frequencies  
- **Tweeter** â†’ High frequencies  

By ensuring each driver only processes its intended band, distortion is reduced and sound quality is improved.

## ðŸ”§ Filters Implemented

### 1. Woofer Low-Pass Filter
- Passes low-frequency range  
- Attenuates mid + high frequencies  
- Cutoff frequency: *X Hz* (from datasheet)  
- Roll-off: *Y dB/octave*

### 2. Midrange Band-Pass Filter
- Passes mid-frequency range  
- Blocks very low and very high frequencies  
- Lower cutoff: *X Hz*  
- Upper cutoff: *Y Hz*  
- Roll-off slopes: *Z dB/octave*
